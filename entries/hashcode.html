                Through the years, I have had the opportunity to take part on
                hackathons competitions some of them local and others, like the
                hashcode, online. After the last hashcode, I wanted to write
                some thoughts and experience that I have learnt through the
                years.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the main things that most people do not give the
                importance necessary is the language choose. Hackathons are
                quick challenges that wants to test our ability to solve
                problems and creating algorithms. They do not want to test how
                good are you with the language (Ok, I know that you need to be
                good with a language in order to be fast and solve the problem
                but that is not the point) but how you solve it. I know how good
                is C, is my favourite language, but you can not use it to solve
                a 3 hours hackathons. Java and C++ are ok languages, not that I
                like them but I acknowledge their relevance and power, but you
                can not use them neither. When you are on a hackathon you need a
                quick and easy language to try your ideas, do not waste your
                time creating a Java package or including libraries in your C++
                code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Choose a language like Python3 (Please use 3 not 2.7), Ruby, or
                one of the many powerfull choices availables. The language
                election is one of the things that I hate the most. People
                choose hobby languages for big projects (see Javascript, Python,
                Ruby,...) and when it comes to quick competitions they choose
                the professional languages. One main advantaje of hobby
                languages is that they show you how good your algorithm is, if
                it never finish, you may need to change your way of thinking.
                Unless your algorithm is some kind of backtracking that you
                should implement on a real language, you should choose a simpler
                language.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another main important thing that I allways apply, is the same
                strategy. Start the competition with the random solution, this
                has two important benefits. The first one is that it helps you
                to create a base code where you will add the real solution. The
                second benefit is that it will help you to understand the
                challenge. Read the problem statement a couple of times and
                start creating the random solution, you will learn about the
                input data as well as the output data in a more practical way.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you have choosen the language and you already had coded the
                random solution, you can start thinking on the solution. At this
                point, I usually start coding the naive solution, or if we are a
                team, one starts coding it. I prefer this previous step before
                the true solution, because it gives you a pretty good skeleton
                to code the final solution. It can also help you to discover
                other solutions while you are coding.
            </p>

            <p>To sum up:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Choose a simple and powerfull language (Python3 for example)
                </li>
                <li>Read a couple of times the problem statement</li>
                <li>Code the random solution</li>
                <li>Read more carefully the problem statement</li>
                <li>(Optional) Code the naive solution</li>
                <li>Code your solution</li>
                <li>Good luck! :)</li>
